# Neural Net For Collision Prediction

Neural network made to predict the best path for a robot to take to avoid collison.

To run locally:

1. Clone the project 
2. It might work with older versions of python but the one I've tested is Python 3.11.5
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `python goal_seeking.py`
